<h1>Design Pattern</h1>

<p>It‚Äôs like a blueprint or template for solving a problem that you can use in many different situations ‚Äî not actual code, but a guide for how to structure your code.</p>

<h2>üì¶ Why Use Design Patterns?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>‚úÖ Promote best practices</li>
  <li>‚úÖ Improve code reusability and readability</li>
  <li>‚úÖ Make your design more flexible and maintainable</li>
  <li>‚úÖ Help communicate ideas clearly (common vocabulary among developers)</li>
</ul>

<h2>üèóÔ∏è Types of Design Patterns:</h2>
<p>Design patterns are generally categorized into three main types:</p>

<h3>1. Creational Design Patterns</h3>
<p>They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. Creational patterns give a lot of flexibility in what gets created, who creates it, how it gets created, and when.</p>

<p><strong>There are two recurring themes in these patterns:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>They encapsulate knowledge about which concrete class the system uses.</li>
  <li>They hide how instances of these classes are created and put together.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Structural Design Patterns</h3>
<p>Structural Design Patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations.</p>

<p><strong>There are two recurring themes in these patterns:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>This pattern is particularly useful for making independently developed class libraries work together.</li>
  <li>Structural Design Patterns describe ways to compose objects to realize new functionality.</li>
  <li>The added flexibility of object composition comes from the ability to change the composition at run-time, which is impossible with static class composition.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Behavioral Design Patterns</h3>
<p>Behavioral Patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. Behavioral patterns describe not just patterns of objects or classes but also the patterns of communication between them.</p>

<p><strong>There are three recurring themes in these patterns:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Behavioral class patterns use inheritance to distribute behavior between classes.</li>
  <li>Behavioral object patterns use object composition rather than inheritance.</li>
  <li>Behavioral object patterns are concerned with encapsulating behavior in an object and delegating requests to it.</li>
</ul>
