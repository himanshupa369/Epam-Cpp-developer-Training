/*
Decorator Design Pattern:-
=> The Decorator Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
=> It involves creating a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components.
=> It is needed to solve the Class Explosion Problem.
=> Real world use case where this pattern is used :-IceCream Shop,Coffee Shop,Pizza Shop;
=> This pattern is useful when you need to add functionality to objects in a flexible and reusable way.
=> It follows the open/closed principle, as new decorators can be added without modifying existing code, making it a powerful tool for building modular and customizable software components.

***********************************************
Real-World Example of Decorator Design Pattern ):-
***********************************************
Consider a video streaming platform where users can watch movies and TV shows. 
Each video content may have additional features or options available, such as subtitles, language preferences, video quality options, and audio enhancements.

**********************************************
Key Components of the Decorator Design Pattern ):-
**********************************************
A) Component Interface :- This is an abstract class or interface that defines the common interface for both the concrete components and decorators. It specifies the operations that can be performed on the objects.
B) Concrete Component :- These are the basic objects or classes that implement the Component interface. They are the objects to which we want to add new behavior or responsibilities.
C) Decorator :- This is an abstract class that also implements the Component interface and has a reference to a Component object. Decorators are responsible for adding new behaviors to the wrapped Component object.
D) Concrete Decorator :- These are the concrete classes that extend the Decorator class. They add specific behaviors or responsibilities to the Component. Each Concrete Decorator can add one or more behaviors to the Component.
