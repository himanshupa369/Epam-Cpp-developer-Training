/*

Factory Method Design :-
=> The Factory Method Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
=> It is used for conditional based object creation. 
=>If your application needs to create different versions of a product or may introduce new types in the future, the Factory 
Method Pattern provides a flexible way to handle these variations by defining specific factory methods for each product type.

ðŸ§  Why Use Factory Method?
=> You want to delegate object creation to child classes.
=> You want to decouple code from specific classes (avoid new everywhere).
=> Helps in extending code easily by just adding new subclasses.

Components of Factory Method Design Pattern:-

Below are the main components of Factory Design Pattern:-
A) Creator(factory) Interface:- This is an abstract class or an interface that declares the factory method. The creator typically contains a method that serves as a factory for creating objects. It may also contain other methods that work with the created objects.
B) Concrete Creator:-- Concrete Creator classes are subclasses of the Creator that implement the factory method to create specific types of objects. Each Concrete Creator is responsible for creating a particular product.
C) Product Interface:- This is the interface or abstract class for the objects that the factory method creates. The Product defines the common interface for all objects that the factory method can create.
D) Concrete Product:- Concrete Product classes are the actual objects that the factory method creates. Each Concrete Product class implements the Product interface or extends the Product abstract class.
