## 📘 Notes: Upcasting, Downcasting & Object Slicing in C++

---

### 🔼 1. **Upcasting**

* **Definition**: Assigning a derived (child) class object to a base class pointer or reference.
* **Happens implicitly (automatically)** — no explicit cast required.
* Enables **polymorphism** when using base class references/pointers.
* ✅ Works only with **pointers or references**, not with concrete (value) objects.

```cpp
Checking c;
Account* accPtr = &c;  // ✅ Upcasting: implicit
Account& accRef = c;   // ✅ Also valid
```

---

### ⚠️ 2. **Object Slicing**

* Occurs when a **derived class object is assigned to a base class object by value**.
* Compiler **removes the derived class-specific part** (slices it off) to fit into the base object.
* Leads to **loss of derived data and behavior**.
* Very common **mistake** in interviews or design.

#### 🔍 Why slicing happens?

* Base class object has **less size** than derived.
* Copying derived → base would overwrite memory if allowed → ❌ undefined behavior.

```cpp
Account acc;
Savings sav;
acc = sav;  // ❌ Object slicing — sav's extra members are sliced off
```

#### 🔁 Also occurs when passing by value:

```cpp
void PrintAccount(Account acc);  // ⚠️ Causes slicing if passed derived object
PrintAccount(Savings());
```

---

### 🔁 3. **Downcasting**

* Assigning a **base class pointer/reference** back to a derived class pointer.
* ❌ **Not safe by default**, requires **explicit cast**.

```cpp
Account* accPtr = new Checking();  // Upcast
Checking* chkPtr = static_cast<Checking*>(accPtr); // ✅ Downcast with explicit cast
```

#### ⚠️ Why compiler prevents implicit downcast?

* Because `accPtr` might point to any subclass (Savings, Checking, etc.)
* Not all base class pointers are necessarily pointing to the desired derived class.

### ✅ 4. **Important Rules**

| Concept        | Requires Cast? | Safe?        | Notes                                            |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Upcasting      | ❌ No           | ✅ Always     | Automatic, polymorphic behavior                  |
| Downcasting    | ✅ Yes          | ⚠️ Risky     | Needs explicit cast (static\_cast/dynamic\_cast) |
| Object Slicing | ❌ No cast      | ❌ Never safe | Happens with assignment/pass by value            |

---

### 💡 5. **Best Practices**

* Always use **pointers/references** when working with inheritance to avoid slicing.
* Use `virtual` functions and destructors for proper polymorphic behavior.
* Use `dynamic_cast` if RTTI and type safety are required (with `virtual`).

```cpp
if (Checking* chk = dynamic_cast<Checking*>(accPtr)) {
    chk->Withdraw();
}
```

---

### 🧪 Quick Visual Recap

```cpp
// Upcast (Safe)
Checking chk;
Account* acc = &chk;

// Downcast (Unsafe unless verified)
Checking* chk2 = static_cast<Checking*>(acc); // Manual
```

---

### 📌 Summary 

* **Upcasting** is automatic and safe.
* **Downcasting** needs explicit cast and should be used cautiously.
* **Object slicing** silently removes child-specific data and breaks polymorphism — avoid it!
* Prefer **references/pointers** in polymorphic code to avoid slicing and enable virtual behavior.

### 📋 Object Slicing in C++ — Summary Table 

| **Aspect**                 | **Description**                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**             | Removing derived class parts when copying to a base class object.       |
| **Occurs When**            | A derived class object is assigned to a **base class object by value**. |
| **Example Code**           | `Account acc = Checking();`                                             |
| **Size Difference**        | Derived class is usually **larger** than base due to extra members.     |
| **Problem**                | Direct copy may **overwrite adjacent memory**, causing corruption.      |
| **Compiler Behavior**      | Compiler **removes (slices)** the derived part to prevent overflow.     |
| **Resulting Issue**        | Only base part is retained → **Loss of derived functionality**.         |
| **Risk in Function Calls** | Also happens when **passing derived object by value** to a function.    |
| **Solution**               | Use **pointers or references** to preserve full object behavior.        |
| **Key Principle**          | Never pass derived object **by value** to a base class object.          |
