//dynamic_cast in C++...

//dynamic_cast is a type of casting operator in C++ that is used for safe runtime type conversion between polymorphic(i.e., classes with virtual functions) objects.

// Key Features of dynamic_cast....

//✔ Used for safe downcasting(from base class to derived class).
//✔ Requires at least one virtual function in the base class to work.
//✔ Performs a runtime check to ensure the cast is valid.
//✔ If the cast is invalid :
               //Returns nullptr when used with pointers.
               //Throws std::bad_cast exception when used with references.


//When to Use dynamic_cast ?
//✅ When working with polymorphic classes(must have a virtual function).
//✅ When you need safe downcasting(checking if an object is actually of the derived type).
//✅ When runtime safety is required(unlike static_cast, which doesn’t check).

//❌ Do NOT use dynamic_cast if :
//    🚫 You don’t have virtual functions(use static_cast).
//    🚫 Performance is critical(dynamic casting is slower due to runtime checks).
