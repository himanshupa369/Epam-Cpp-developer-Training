🔹 L — Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

🧠 Definition:
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

That means:
Derived classes should extend behavior, not break expectations.

In other words:
"If class B is a subclass of class A, we should be able to replace A with B without breaking the program."

Def:: Substitutability is a principle in object-oriented programming and it states that, in a computer program, if S is a Subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S
=> Which means, Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types
=> More formally, the Liskov substitution principle (LSP) is a particular definition of a subtyping relation, called (strong) behavioral subtyping
=> This Principle is introduced by Barbara Liskov in 1987 during her conference address on Data abstraction and hierarchy
=> This principle is just an extension of the Open Close Principle

💥 Why It Matters:
- Promotes safe polymorphism
- Prevents unexpected bugs when using inheritance
- Keeps code interchangeable and flexible

🧪 Real-World Analogy:
A Bird is an Animal.
You can substitute a Bird where an Animal is expected — but if you try substituting a Penguin and expect it to fly... boom! 🐧✈️💥

Implementation guidelines : In the process of development we should ensure that 
1) No new exceptions can be thrown by the subtype unless they are part of the existing exception hierarchy.
2) We should also ensure that Clients should not know which specific subtype they are calling, nor should they need to know that. The client should behave the same regardless of the subtype instance that it is given.
3) And last but not the least, New derived classes just extend without replacing the functionality of old classes

📌 Summary:

✅ Good Practice                     ❌ Bad Practice
-----------------------------       -----------------------------
Subclasses respect base behavior    Subclasses override or remove essential behavior
Consistent return values            Unexpected exceptions or logic
Safe, predictable substitution      Breaks polymorphism assumptions

// 📐 Mini Project: Area Calculator for Shapes

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <memory>
#include <cmath>

// 🔷 Base class
class Shape {
public:
    virtual double area() const = 0;
    virtual ~Shape() = default;
};

// ⬛ Rectangle class (inherits from Shape)
class Rectangle : public Shape {
    double width, height;
public:
    Rectangle(double w, double h) : width(w), height(h) {}
    double area() const override {
        return width * height;
    }
};

// ⚪ Circle class (inherits from Shape)
class Circle : public Shape {
    double radius;
public:
    Circle(double r) : radius(r) {}
    double area() const override {
        return M_PI * radius * radius;
    }
};

// 📏 Area calculator — works with any Shape (LSP compliant)
class AreaCalculator {
public:
    double totalArea(const std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Shape>>& shapes) {
        double total = 0;
        for (const auto& shape : shapes) {
            total += shape->area(); // safe substitution: works for any Shape
        }
        return total;
    }
};

int main() {
    std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Shape>> shapes;

    shapes.push_back(std::make_shared<Rectangle>(10, 5));
    shapes.push_back(std::make_shared<Circle>(3));

    AreaCalculator calc;
    std::cout << "Total Area: " << calc.totalArea(shapes) << "\n";

    return 0;
}

/*
✅ LSP Applied:

We created a base Shape class and derived Rectangle and Circle.
All subclasses can be used in place of Shape without breaking the program.

Component        | Responsibility
-----------------|--------------------------------------
Shape            | Abstract base with area() method
Rectangle        | Implements area for rectangle
Circle           | Implements area for circle
AreaCalculator   | Works with Shape pointers (polymorphism)

All subclasses are substitutable — no broken behavior or surprises.
