/*
🔹 S — Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

🧠 Definition:
A class should have only one reason to change.

That means:
One class → One job → One responsibility

💥 Why It Matters:
- Reduces complexity
- Easier to debug and test
- Makes your code modular and reusable
- Prevents unintended side-effects when modifying code

🧪 Real-World Analogy:
A Chef cooks.
A Waiter serves food.
A Cashier handles payment.
Would you make one person do all three?
Probably not — same with your classes!

📌 Summary:

✅ Good Practice             ❌ Bad Practice
---------------------       ------------------------
1 class = 1 responsibility   1 class = many jobs
Clear separation of concerns Tight coupling of logic
Easier to test and extend    Hard to maintain/debug

/*
✅ SRP Applied:

Each class has a single concern:

- Invoice        → Business logic
- InvoicePrinter → Output logic
- InvoiceSaver   → Persistence logic

Class            | Responsibility
-----------------|-------------------------------
Invoice          | Handles data and calculation
InvoicePrinter   | Deals with presentation
InvoiceSaver     | Handles file persistence
