  <h1>üî† SOLID Principles</h1>

  <p>The SOLID principles are five key object-oriented design principles that help make software:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Easier to maintain</li>
    <li>More scalable</li>
    <li>Less buggy</li>
    <li>Flexible for change</li>
  </ul>

  <p>They were popularized by <strong>Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)</strong> and are often used in C++, Java, Python, and other OOP languages.</p>

## ‚úÖ Core Design Principles in C++ (SOLID)

---

### **1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

> **A class should have only one reason to change.**

* üõ†Ô∏è Each class/function should handle a single part of the functionality.
* ‚ùå Don't mix unrelated logic (e.g., file I/O and business rules in one class).
* ‚úÖ Keeps code **modular**, **testable**, and **easy to refactor**.

#üè† Analogy:
A chef cooks food. A cashier handles billing. You wouldn't want a chef to handle payments too.
---

### **2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

> **Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.**

* üì¶ Add new functionality via **inheritance**, **virtual functions**, or **templates** ‚Äî not by changing existing code.
* ‚úÖ Encourages **extensible** design while protecting **existing code** from bugs.

#üè† Analogy:
A USB port allows new devices to be added without changing the port itself.
---

### **3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

> **Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.**

* üß† Any instance of a base class should be replaceable with a derived class without altering program behavior.
* ‚úÖ Promotes **polymorphism** and avoids runtime surprises.
* ‚ùå Don't violate expected behavior in a subclass (e.g., override but ignore a method's expected outcome).

#üè† Analogy:
You can use a credit card or debit card at the ATM ‚Äì both follow the same interface.
---

### **4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

> **Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.**

* üß© Split **fat interfaces** into smaller, focused ones.
* ‚úÖ Improves **modularity** and **testability**.
* ‚ùå Don‚Äôt make a class implement unrelated methods just because they exist in a large interface.

#üè† Analogy:
A printer that only prints shouldn‚Äôt be forced to support scanning.
---

### **5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

> **Depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.**

* üéØ High-level modules shouldn't depend on low-level modules.
* ‚úÖ Use **abstract classes** or **interfaces**, and inject them as dependencies (via constructor or setter).
* üõ†Ô∏è Enables **flexible architecture** (e.g., switch from file-based logging to database logging without changing business logic).

#üè† Analogy:
A TV remote doesn't care whether you're using a Sony or LG TV, as long as both follow the "IR protocol."
